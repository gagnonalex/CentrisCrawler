# Introduction 
The goal of this project is to use the Microsoft technology stack to create a web crawler to get information from centris.ca and generate trends and notification.

A web .Net app will let the user select dynamic filters from centris  to collect data,  store it, create trends & dashboards and let the user configure notifications.

Those notifications will be pushed via a team bot that will be build on top of botframework. This will let us add some flavors to the bot behavior using natural language and AI.

We will then make sure this whole application can be easily deploy on any OS with Docker.
